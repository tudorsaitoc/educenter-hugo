### Afternoon session 
Fencers compete in 15 touch bouts

The overall competitive atmosphere will be much like a tournament but with a focus on providing fencers with the most appropriate match-ups based on their skill level.

Fencers will continue in the event regardless of results so most fencers will get more bouts than a typical tournament. They will also get more appropriately competitive bouts. This will best help to develop their skills and provide the best experience to promote their development.

Additionally, priority will also be given to matchups of fencers that would not normally be able to bout against each other because of club affiliation or geography. With this format, fencers will not have to worry about traveling or investing in going to the event to end up predominantly fencing club mates.

The Waiver of Liability MUST be signed before taking part in this session.
Fencers who are under 13 years of age and with national points who wish to take part should have their coach contact the organizer via email. ob01@TxState.Edu
